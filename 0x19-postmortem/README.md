# Postmortem: Website Slow Loading Due to Unoptimized Images 🚀🐢

## Issue Summary
- **Duration of the Outage:** October 10, 2023, 10:00 AM - 10:45 AM (UTC)
- **Impact:** The website was slower than a turtle on a leisurely stroll, affecting about 75% of users. Some pages took over 10 seconds to load—long enough for a coffee break! ☕
- **Root Cause:** The main reason for the slow loading was that images were not optimized. They didn’t have the `loading="lazy"` attribute, and they were not compressed, making them as heavy as a hippo in a tutu. 🦛

## Timeline
- **10:00 AM:** The monitoring system sent an alert, saying, "Help! We're slow!" 🆘
- **10:05 AM:** An engineer, armed with coffee and determination, began investigating the website's performance.
- **10:10 AM:** The engineer thought the server might be overloaded, but CPU and memory usage were chill—like a cat in a sunbeam. 😺
- **10:20 AM:** A customer complained about slow loading times, prompting a deeper dive into the issue.
- **10:30 AM:** The team discovered that images were not optimized. Cue the dramatic music! 🎶
- **10:40 AM:** The issue was escalated to the web development team, who donned their superhero capes for quick action. 🦸‍♂️
- **10:45 AM:** The problem was fixed by compressing images and adding `loading="lazy"` to all image tags. Victory dance time! 💃

## Root Cause and Resolution
The slow loading was caused by not optimizing images before the website launch. The images were large and loaded all at once, making the website slower than a snail in a marathon. 🐌 Without lazy loading, all images tried to load at the same time, using too much bandwidth and slowing down the page.

To fix the issue, we did the following:
1. Compressed all images using a tool to reduce their file sizes without losing quality. Think of it as a diet for our images! 🥗
2. Added the `loading="lazy"` attribute to all image tags, so images would only load when they were visible on the screen. No more unnecessary heavy lifting! 💪
3. Reviewed all website images to ensure they were optimized. A thorough spring cleaning! 🧹

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
To avoid this problem in the future, we suggest the following improvements and tasks:

### Improvements:
- Create a standard process for optimizing images before deploying the website. No more lazy images! 💤
- Regularly check website images to make sure they are optimized. A routine check-up! 🩺

### TODO List:
1. **Use Image Optimization Tools:** Set up tools to automatically compress images before they are deployed. Let technology do the heavy lifting! 🤖
2. **Add Lazy Loading Automatically:** Update website templates to include `loading="lazy"` for all images. Lazy is the new cool! 😎
3. **Monitor Page Load Times:** Improve monitoring to track page load times and alert the team if they get too slow. Like a watchdog for speed! 🐕
4. **Conduct Performance Checks:** Schedule regular checks of the website to find and fix slow areas. Think of it as a performance spa day! 🧖‍♀️
5. **User Feedback System:** Create a way for users to report slow loading times directly, so we can respond quickly. Because we care! ❤️
